I have not done any major changes to this mod, I've simply updated the .cfg files with more up-to-date Modules as well as possible tweaking to my personal tastes. See the ChangeLog for details. Please Remember this is WIP

This ReBox can be Installed on top of the Original SpacedockRedeployed Mod. All I am providing is updated cfgs and extra parts I've found on the forums that is not/should be included in the original file structure(in my opinion). Otherwise everything is same ol same ol.

*This version does NOT contain the MiniDock as of writing this! No changes has been made to that part yet.*

*If you do not want the MiniDock: Delete/Uninstall SpaceDockRedeployed via Ckan or manually before installing this derivitive.*
